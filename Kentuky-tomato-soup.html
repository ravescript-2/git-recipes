    <p>2 stalks celery, chopped</p>
    <p>2 cloves garlic, minced</p>
    <p>¼ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</p>
    <p>2 ½ cups chopped fresh tomatoes</p>
    <p>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</p>
    <p>¾ cup strong brewed coffee</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in a stock pot over medium heat. Stir in the onion, carrots, celery, garlic, and parsley; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, tomato sauce, coffee, water, sugar, salt, and pepper. Bring the soup to a boil and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour the hot soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Stir in the cream and heat until warm. Do not boil.</li>
